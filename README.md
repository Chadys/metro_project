### Use the command make and then ./metro to start the program

There is another version of the program, simpler and quicker but searching only for one quickest path and not all.

You can access it with
```bash
git checkout uniline_station_version
```

and to go back to the first version you replace "uniline_station_version" by the branch's name "master"
